# Day 6 - Deep Learning for Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

This is part of my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge.  
On **Day 6**, I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the popular **MNIST** dataset.

##  Goal  
Train a deep learning model to accurately classify handwritten digits (0–9).

##  Dataset  
**MNIST** — a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training image processing systems.  
Link: [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

##  How It Works

- Loaded and preprocessed the MNIST dataset (normalization, reshaping).
- Built a **CNN** with:
  - Convolutional layers
  - Max-pooling layers
  - Dense layers with softmax output
- Compiled the model with **categorical cross-entropy** loss.
- Trained the model and visualized predictions on test samples.

##  Highlights

- Applied **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image recognition.
- Achieved high accuracy on handwritten digit classification.
- Visualized model predictions for real-world test samples.
